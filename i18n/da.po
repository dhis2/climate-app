msgid "About this app"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This pilot app is part of the ongoing “DHIS2 for Climate“ project. It will "
"get frequent updates, so please make sure you have the latest version from "
"the DHIS2 App Hub. The app is developed by the University of Oslo, but it is"
" not a DHIS2 core app. Useful parts of this app might be incorporated into "
"the DHIS2 core in the future, based on your feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The app allows you to explore and import temperature, precipitation, "
"humidity and heat stress data in DHIS2. The main data source is ERA5-Land, "
"which is considered the most accurate and complete global climate dataset "
"available. The video below shows you how this dataset was created by "
"combining weather observations with a weather model (climate reanalysis)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read about ERA5-Land on Copernicus Climate Data Store"

msgid ""
"In additon to ERA5-Land, precipitation data can also be imported from the "
"CHIRPS dataset. For heat stress we use data from ERA5-HEAT."

"We recommend importing data into DHIS2 data elements. This will allow you to"
" combine weather and climate data with your health data across all DHIS2 "
"analytics apps. You need to configure your DHIS2 instance before you can "
"import data. See our guide by clicking on “Setup guide”."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the configuration is done, you can import temperature and "
"precipitation data under “Import data”."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the data is imported, you should generate the analytics tables in the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The data is calculated for your organsation units on Google Earth Engine. "

"are close to each other (within the resolution), they will have the same "
